    <h1>The Baics of the Web & HTML -   Lesson 1</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="subject-content">
    <p>The world wide web is made up of HTML documents that can be connected via hyperlinks.</p>
    <p>The main pieces of the web:<br> 
      <ul>
        <li>computer user</li>
        <li>computer & browser</li>
        <li>the internet</li>
        <li>servers</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="subject-content">
    <h3>HTML</h3>
      <p>HTML documents are the heart of the web and are made up of text, content, the HTML mark-up, references to other documents and links</p>
   </div>
  <div class="subject-content">
    <h3>TAGS</h3>
      <p>Tags are used to mark-up HTML documents for formating. A tag consists of an opening tag and a closing tag and the whole tag is called an element.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="subject-content">
    <h3>Computers are stupid</h3>
      <p>Computers are very dumb machines, they will only do what the programmer tells the machine what to do.  Because of this, programmers need to be precise on instructions and be sensative to typos in the markup
       </p>
    </div>
  <div class="subject-content">
    <h3>Links</h3>
      <p>Links are used to connect an HTML document to any other document on the <a href="www.espn.com">web</a>.
    In the previous sentence, web is highlighted in blue and links to www.espn.com.
      </p>
    </div>
  <div class="subject-content">
    <h3>Inline tags vs Block tags</h3>
      <p>Inline tags just end a sentence where you put the br tag. 
Block tags create an invisable box around the text where the box can be formatted
      Block tags are the Paragraph tags
      </p>

    <h1>The structure of an HTML page - lesson 2</h1>
  </div>
    <div class="subject-content">
      <p>A website is like a structure of a house<br>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML is the structure (rooms)</li>
        <li>CSS is the style of the house (color, texture)</li>
        <li>Javascript are the interactive components of house (remote control)</li>
     </ul>
    </div>
   <div class="subject-content">
    <p>HTML defines the structure and content of a page.  Using tags to create elements for the page creates a DOM, or tree-like structure of the page with HTML.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="subject-content">
    <p>CSS styles the elements of HTML and uses syntax and rules to create style for the page</p>
  </div>
  <div class="subject-content">
    <p>Everything on a webpage is a box. Boxify page using pencil first before setting up basic structure of the page with div tags. You dont have to put contents in tags at the beginning, just put the tags to start and fill in later. Label div tags with classes for easy styling later. One of the benefits of giving div tags classes is that when you go to style the HTML in CSS, you can style by class name, saving time by not having to style each HTML tag individually.  This not only saves time, it also avoids repetition by not having to style each similar div tag.</p>
  </div>
<div class="title">
  <h1>Lesson 3 - Styling with CSS</h1>
</div>
    <div class="subject-content">
      <p>CSS is used to style the elements of the HTML of a webpage (see lesson 2). CSS stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> and there are two key features of CSS to remember:
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading means that the most specific rule applies to all elements of a page. Think of federal laws down to city laws. The city law would applied federally as well.</li>
          <li>The second key features is the idea of inhertiance--the idea that styling an element not only applies to that element, but also to its descendants.  It uses the document tree and the descendant elements only inherit text properties.</li> 
       </ul>
      To style in CSS, start with either a html tag, or a html element class, which is how CSS controls how the HTML tags look.  For reference, use the CSS reference for attributes and to check CSS code--this is found on the Mozilla Developer Site Network.
  </div>
  <div class="subject-content">
    <h3>The box model revisited</h3>
      <p>The box model concept is used to position boxes on a web page and consists of 4 properties:
    <ul>
     <li>Margin--space between boxes on a page and is transparent, you ca't see it</li>
     <li>Border--basically the outline of a box</li>
     <li>Padding--clears an area around the center of the box</li>
     <li>Content--the center of the box</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="subject-content">
    <h3>Box sizing & positioning</h3>
    <p>Boxes can be sized in three ways: size by pixils, size by using a percent, or by using "box-sizing: border-box" for every element.
    Box positioning for divs by default takes up the whole width of the page.  In order to have divs appear next to eachother (like an image and text next to it), use the "display: flex" rule.</p>
    <p><b>Always use the process of code, test & refine when using HTML & CSS and always use the validators to check code for errors</b>
